# Kickstarter
Research Question:
To ascertain if certain categories of start-ups receive more crowdfunding and are more likely to succeed than others.

The dataset I am using is from Kickstarter 2010-2018. 
It consists the information about all the projects such as the fundings they received, the goal, number of investors, the status of the project, and other details. 
The project analyzes different categories of data by looking at multiple factors. 
These factors include success rate in different categories, investment received by each category, etc 
The analysis will help the investor predict if a project has the potential to be successful. 
Help the startup get an idea of when they can receive the target goals. 
Also, help motivate upcoming entrepreneurs by showing them that diverse categories can also be successful.
