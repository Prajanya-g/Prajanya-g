My second project constructed using oop concepts. It was a group project and we created text based game like ZELDA. The player can move around different rooms pic objects 
fight monsters to rescue the princess. 
These are some basic commands: 
move then a direction to move to a new room
pick then item name to pick an item
attack then monster to attack the monster
exit then " Game " to exit the game
