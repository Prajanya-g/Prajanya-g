# TextBase Games

It the second project I worked on. It was a team project which taught me a-lot about teamwork and leadership. We as a team were looking at various project ideas and I personally wanted to work on a test based game. Then I came across an open source project [Zelda](https://awesomeopensource.com/project/OSSpk/Zelda-Game). I discussed with the group and we decided on doing our project have a similar plot and feature. I then took the charge and constructed the design documented with UML diagrams. Then after a good discussion we divided the work amongst ourselves. The project is constructed using oop concepts like Inheritance, Composition, Association, Polymorphism etc. I was assigned to make two object called item and bag. Further, I wrote the main file and we together worked on debugging the program after intial testing. The project has automated testing and a unit test was also conducted.
