# Security as a challenge in IOT 

An IoT is an ecosystem consisting of web-enabled smart devices that use embedded systems, to collect, send and act on data they acquire from their environments.
Think of a fridge that could scan bar codes and identify which items were due to go off; perhaps even hook up with your online shopping order to put together a shopping list of things that were running low, or give you recipe suggestions based on what you had available. However, 
>As soon as an item becomes ‘intelligent’, it becomes open to being hacked.

There are various types of attacks that they can launch:
1. Denial of Service attacks
2. Physical attacks
3. Network attacks
4. Encryption attacks

IoT is a gaining more and more popularity and a few years back it was a fiction to see home appliances work like that. This fact fascinates me the most and motivated me to research on the topic. Security is a major concern in todays world and rapid advance in technology requires us to find an effective solution to this never ending challenge.
Some Present solutions to this problem include 
1. Managing updates to the device and to the installed IoT application:
2. Secure communication
3. Monitor and detect
4. Authentication and authorization
5. Secure devices
6. Data integrity
7. Secure control applications
