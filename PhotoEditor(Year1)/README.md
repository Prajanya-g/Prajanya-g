#PhotoEditor

My first project in first year of university semester one. I chose to make a photo editor because I was facinates to learn how images are manipulate in matlab using basic code and it was fun to play with the pixels of the image and try different things with it 

It a photoeditor with basic feature like crop, resize, brightness adjust and flip and rotate. 

The code is well commented and is easy to read. It is well tested using a unit testing model. 

The projects demonstrates the understanding basic concepts like function, for loop, if else statement and switch.
